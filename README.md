lt3obj
======

An implementation of the object-oriented paradigm for `expl3` of the LaTeX3 project.

> *This project is paused for the time being in order to research the functionality and concept of `xtemplate`.*
> *Once the ideas behind `xtemplate` have been solidified in the greater LaTeX3 system, perhaps `lt3obj` may be valuable.*
> *In any case, this project has no clear vision until, fittingly, everything else has been seen and thought upon.*
